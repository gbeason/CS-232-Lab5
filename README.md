# CS-232-Lab5
## Introduction
Lab 5 for CS 232 Computer Programming II generates 30 shapes using random parameters and displays them in a GUI.
## Installation
Click the green "clone or download" button, click "download ZIP", locate the CS-232-Lab5-master.zip file, and extract the folder.
Navigate to the dist folder inside the CS-232-Lab5-master directory.
Copy the CS232Lab5d.jar file to any location on your computer.
## Operation
Double click the CS232Lab5d.jar file. 
The program's main class will then run a loop which will generate 10 instances of each shape (circle, rectangle, triangle) with random parameters.
The shapes properties are determined by three classes, Point, Shapes, and one of the three individual shape child classes.
After all thirty shapes are created, the JavaLab5D class draws them into the GUI at random locations determined by values in the main class.  The area of each shape (as calculated in the individual shape classes) is also displayed on each shape.
